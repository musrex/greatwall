# Greatwall (working title)
## A Web App for small restaurants

Greatwall is a simple to use web app for building websites for small restaurants. 
It uses Flask on the back-end, and some good ol' CSS, a sprinkling of Vanilla JS,
as well as the Jinja templating engine for the front-end.  

---

**The issue:** Many small restaurants don't have a web presence, or their web presence  
consists of a picture of their menu uploaded to Yelp, Facebook, or Google images.  

**The goal:** The goal is to create a simple platform that allows restaurant owners  
to create menus and items for the menus as easily as possibe.  

**Details**
  - For now, a dev needs to customize the front end using CSS. I hope to change this
so that an owner can change the background image/color, fonts, and add images.
  - The goal is to be small, simple, and hyper-fixate on small restaurant owners. These
owners aren't always keen on using online payment sytems and instead take orders via phone
calls. I want to follow suit - no online payment processing, and instead just linking their
phone number.
